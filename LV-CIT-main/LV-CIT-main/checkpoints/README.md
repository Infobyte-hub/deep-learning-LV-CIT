Please get checkpoints for ASL from https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ASL/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md, download TResNet_L for MS-COCO with mAP 86.6 and TResNet_XL for PASCAL-VOC with mAP 96.0, and rename them to `voc_checkpoint.pth` and `coco_checkpoint.pth` respectively.

Please get checkpoints for ML-GCN from https://github.com/megvii-research/ML-GCN?tab=readme-ov-file#download-pretrain-models, and rename them to `voc_checkpoint.pth.tar` and `coco_checkpoint.pth.tar` respectively.

Please get checkpoints for MSRN from https://github.com/chehao2628/MSRN?tab=readme-ov-file#4-download-pretrained-models, and rename them to `voc_checkpoint.pth.tar` and `coco_checkpoint.pth.tar` respectively, and download pretrained ResNet model from https://github.com/chehao2628/MSRN?tab=readme-ov-file#2-download-resnet-101-pretrained-model, rename it to `resnet101_for_msrn.pth.tar`.
